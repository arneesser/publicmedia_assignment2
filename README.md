# publicmedia_movie_recommender
This project was done towards receiving university credits in the 'Personalization for Public Media' elective in Applied Data Science. Students were tasked with developing a recommender system on a provided dataset. 

Here I showcase the scripts of various recommender algorithms used for my mock-up movie recommender system that aimed to provide streaming services to a teenager target audience with a more social and interconnected usability approach.
